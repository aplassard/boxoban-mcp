        # This test setup is tricky. The 2x2 check is for any box (r,c) then it checks (r,c+1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1)
        # So if (1,1) is the top-left of the 2x2 block:
        # Box (1,1) is on target. Skipped.

        #   It would check for a 2x2 starting at (1,2), i.e. (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). This is not the 2x2 block we want.
        # If the code finds box (2,1) (not on target):

        # The current 2x2 deadlock logic in _is_deadlock is:
        # if board[r][c] == self.BOX: (current is box, assume this is (1,1) for the target 2x2 block)
        #    if (r+1 < H and c+1 < W and board[r][c+1]==BOX and board[r+1][c]==BOX and board[r+1][c+1]==BOX):

        # But another box in that 2x2 block might be the top-left of another 2x2 check, or just not be on a target.
        # The loop `for r, row... for c, char... if char == BOX: if (r,c) in targets: continue` is key.
        # In "#####\\n#*$@#\n#$$ #\n# ..#\\n#####"

        # (2,1) is '$'. Not on target. Check 2x2 from (2,1): (2,1)BOX, (2,2)BOX, (3,1)TARGET, (3,2)TARGET. No 2x2 of boxes.
        # (2,2) is '$'. Not on target. Check 2x2 from (2,2): (2,2)BOX, (2,3)EMPTY, (3,2)TARGET, (3,3)EMPTY. No 2x2 of boxes.

        # The 2x2 rule should apply if *any* 2x2 of boxes exists and *not all* of them are on goals.
        # The current code says: if I find a box at (r,c) AND it's the top-left of a 2x2 group of boxes,
